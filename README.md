## Inspiration
A lot of us are very interested in news, politics and journalism. We realised that we could come up with a hack to a daily problem that we face when reading news. It is difficult to filter and categorize news based on our interests, and get the news that we like in the form of an easily accessible newsletter delivered by mail. Taking cognisance of this issue, we at mynewswire.tech came up with a way to solve this wonderful issue. 


## What it does
Getting relevant news on topics that you like goes beyond just a Google search. 
mynewswire allows users to get customized news in one click. Users can select their location and  interests to get the most recent news, and they can subscribe to our email newsletter for a daily dose of customized news feeds by entering their email.
